# Treemap Visualization

This project is a Treemap Visualization inspired by FreeCodeCamp's Data Visualization challenges. It was built using D3.js, focusing on fulfilling specific user stories for displaying hierarchical data effectively.

## Project Overview

The app visualizes hierarchical data sets using a treemap layout, allowing users to explore various data categories interactively. It includes the following features:

- **Interactive Treemap**: Users can hover over tiles to view detailed information about each data point.
- **Dynamic Legend**: A dynamically generated legend helps users understand the data categories and their corresponding colors.
- **Dataset Selection**: Users can select from different datasets to view corresponding treemaps, such as video game sales, movie sales, and Kickstarter pledges.

## Features

- **Treemap Display**: Visualizes hierarchical data with proportional area representation.
- **Hover Tooltip**: Displays additional information about each tile on hover, including name, category, and value.
- **Dynamic Legend**: Shows a legend representing different data categories.
- **Dataset Selection**: Switch between different datasets (video games, movies, Kickstarter) via URL parameters.

## Technologies Used

- **D3.js**: Used for creating the treemap layout and handling SVG elements.
- **HTML/CSS**: Structures the web page and styles the components.
- **JavaScript**: Provides functionality for fetching data, creating the treemap, and handling interactions.

## Datasets

The following datasets are used in this project:

1. **Video Game Sales**: Top 100 Most Sold Video Games Grouped by Platform.
2. **Movie Sales**: Top 100 Highest Grossing Movies Grouped By Genre.
3. **Kickstarter Pledges**: Top 100 Most Pledged Kickstarter Campaigns Grouped By Category.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file for the project.
- **styles.css**: Contains the CSS styles for the project.
- **script.js**: JavaScript file handling data fetching, treemap creation, and interactions.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Hover over tiles in the treemap to view tooltips with detailed information.
4. View the legend to understand the categories.
